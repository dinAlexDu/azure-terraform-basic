# Azure Basic Infrastructure with Terraform
---
**A Hands-on Lab for Deploying Basic Infrastructure in Azure using Terraform**
---

This project demonstrates how to create a basic infrastructure in Azure using Terraform. It includes deploying a Resource Group, a Virtual Network (VNet) with subnets, and an Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) with a public IP address.

## Project Objectives

- **Demonstrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  
  Automate the creation of Azure resources using Terraform.

- **Deploy a Virtual Network (VNet):**  
  Set up a Virtual Network with custom address spaces and subnets.

- **Launch a Virtual Machine:**  
  Deploy an Ubuntu VM with SSH access and a public IP address.

- **Ensure Connectivity:**  
  Validate secure access to the VM using SSH over port 22.

## Steps Implemented

1. **Resources Created:**  
   - **Resource Group:**  
     - Name: `BasicInfraRG`  

   - **Virtual Network:**  
     - Name: `BasicVNet`  
     - Address Space: `10.0.0.0/16`  
     - Subnets:  
       - `default` - `10.0.0.0/24`  
       - `BasicSubnet` - `10.0.1.0/24`  

   - **Virtual Machine:**  
     - Name: `UbuntuVM`  
     - Operating System: Ubuntu Server 20.04  
     - Size: Standard B1s (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM)  
     - Public IP: Static, automatically assigned  

2. **Initialize Terraform:**  
   - Run `terraform init` to prepare the working directory.  

3. **Validate Configuration:**  
   - Use `terraform validate` to ensure the configuration is correct.  

4. **Plan and Apply Infrastructure:**  
   - Generate a plan with `terraform plan`.  
   - Apply the changes using `terraform apply`.  

5. **Test Connectivity:**  
   - Retrieve the VM's public IP from Terraform output or Azure Portal.  
   - Connect to the VM using SSH:  
     ```bash
     ssh azureuser@<PUBLIC_IP>
     ```

6. **Cleanup Resources:**  
   - Avoid unnecessary costs by destroying the infrastructure after use:  
     ```bash
     terraform destroy
     ```
